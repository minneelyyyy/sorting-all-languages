# Sorting
This is a collection of the same program written in multiple languages.

The current language list is:
- Rust
- C
- Javascript

# Rules
The rules are as follows:
- the program can take an infinite number of integer arguments separated by spaces `sorting 3 9 4 8 5 3`
- the user should not have to pass the number of arguments as an argument
- the program should print the numbers in sorted order separated by newlines
- if the user passes an argument that isn't an integer, the error should be `error: 'arg' is not a valid number` and exit with `1`. Any other errors do not need to match anything specific.
